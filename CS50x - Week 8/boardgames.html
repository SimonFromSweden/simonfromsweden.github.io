            <h1>Boardgames</h1>
            <p>Playing board games is a perfect opportunity to connect and open up; it also helps to display a creative side of personality in non-intrusive ways, which can be beneficial for quiet individuals. Board games are an amazing tool for shy children and timid adults. Playing helps them to develop stronger senses of individuality and creativity. This leads to greater self-esteem and a feeling of being included and noticed.

            <p>“There is something about the co-location of physical items, sitting across from each other at a table, sharing pizza, that playing with digital board games online simply does not replace.” — Brian Magerko, digital-media professor at Georgia Tech

                “It’s good to get together with friends and family and engage in face-to-face interaction. I enjoy spending quality time while enjoying board games.” — Pat Stephenson Youth Services Assistant, Bensalem Branch</p>
            <p>Board games help children learn important social skills such as waiting, turn taking, sharing, how to cope with losing, making conversation, problem solving, compromising, collaborating and being flexible. These skills are important in school-aged children so that they can appropriately respond in social situations both inside and outside of the home. Games like Candyland and Chutes and Ladders teach children that flexibility is crucial because luck can change very quickly. Children quickly learn that these games are not necessarily about skill acquisition but more about how one may cope with change in a playful environment.</p>
            <p>As an vid boardgamer myself I can confirm that all these different benefits are for real. I actually feel like board gaming makes me a happpier person. It has a lot to do with my will to win and my love for playing games and competing. The social aspect is of course crucial. It's just a good hang, so to speak! I recommend you begin with the game carcasonne. </p>
