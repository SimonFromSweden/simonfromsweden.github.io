               <h1>Climbing</h1>
               <p>
                  Rock climbing is very different from other popular sports. You
                  don’t necessarily need to be young, old, tall or short to be a
                  great rock climber. Sure, there may be factors that predispose
                  you to the sport, like a background in gymnastics,, but
                  generally speaking, anyone can excel at rock climbing. Some of
                  the strongest climbers in the world range from about 13 to 35
                  years old. Climbing is truly a very inclusive and enjoyable
                  sport.

                     Climbing can come in many forms. You either climb with
                     ropes, or without ropes ("bouldering").

               Not surprisingly, it takes strength to climb straight up a
               vertical wall. But don’t worry if you’re not already a weight
               lifter with ripped biceps and shoulders. You’ll be working all of
               your muscle groups simultaneously, and each day you climb you’ll
               grow stronger. In fact, research suggests that dynamic movements
               requiring multiple muscle groups are more challenging (i.e., they
               build strength faster and more effectively) than simpler
               exercises. Takeaway: you get a full range of strength-building
               benefits without having to pump iron at the gym. Worth it? Oh,
               yeah.<br /><br />

               And climbing isn’t just about your arms, shoulders, and back.
               Yes, you’ll get a great upper body workout, but you also need
               core strength to keep yourself parallel to the wall. That’s
               especially true as you increase your skill and start taking on
               more challenging walls, like the ones that begin to angle out
               over your head. Experienced climbers also use their legs just as
               much as their arms as they ascend. Pushing up with your legs
               while pulling with your arms keeps you from tiring out too
               quickly and enables you to climb longer and farther than relying
               on your arms alone.

                     mountains)? Naturally, there is the pleasure we get from
                     the climbing process itself and from our victories, but as
                     well as the delights of exercise in a mountain environment,
                     there is also the process, coming every time as a surprise,
                     of self-discovery deepening a little further with every
                     climb: who we are, how far we can go, what is our
                     potential, where are the limits of our technique, our
                     strength, our skill, our mountaineering sense: discoveries
                     whose acceptance means that, if necessary, we may turn back
                     and return another time, several times if need be-‘Tomorrow
                     is a new day.’”</em
