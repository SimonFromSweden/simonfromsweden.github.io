                  Why play disc golf? Disc golf is the perfect community sport,
                  it's cheap, and it is easy for anyone to learn and play. Disc
                  golfers get great exercise, and great sense of community
                  develops around a local course. Disc golf can attract young
                  people to use parks and open spaces, and help them develop a
                  feeling of ownership and responsibility for this community
                  space. Disc golf is an ideal activity for community groups and
                  schools, because it is accessible to everyone, fun, and a
                  great learning opportunity for everything from physics to
                  physical fitness.

                  Disc golf is a game that can easy be embraced by a large and
                  diverse pool of participants. Young players are taking up the
                  game as courses show up in their hoods.<br /><br />College
                  students are embracing disc golf as a low-cost source of
                  social interaction. Families are not only playing locally, but
                  are discovering great appeal in taking disc golf vacations to
                  beautiful course locations.<br /><br />Since it takes very
                  little financial commitment and the learning curve is so
                  quick, disc golf has very few limitations to its growth and
                  public appeal. New players are flooding to courses as quickly
                  as they are created. <br /><br />According to the 2016 state
                  of disc golf survey (a voluntary online survey that was not
                  likely to be completed by youth or older people who arenâ€™t
                  involved with social media), disc golfers can be found in all
                  ages. <br /><br />There is a significant number of players in
                  every age bracket. While most players surveyed are between
                  22-50, disc golf is also a great retirement activity with
                  people playing into their seventies.
